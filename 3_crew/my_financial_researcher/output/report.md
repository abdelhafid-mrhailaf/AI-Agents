# Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA)  
## Comprehensive Research Report – October 2025  

---

## Executive Summary  

Tesla remains the pre‑eminent global electric‑vehicle (EV) and clean‑energy company, combining a high‑growth vehicle platform with a rapidly scaling software and energy business. As of Q1 2024, the company posted **$25.1 bn** of revenue ( + 23 % YoY) and **$2.9 bn** of GAAP net income ( + 166 % YoY), underpinned by **$24.3 bn** in cash and a **net‑cash position of ≈ $19 bn**.  

Key take‑aways:

| Insight | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| **Sustained profitability** – GAAP profit in every quarter since 2020, driven by higher Model 3/Y margins and expanding Full‑Self‑Driving (FSD) subscription revenues. | Strong earnings visibility; supports dividend‑like cash returns (buy‑backs). |
| **Robust free cash flow** – $9 bn+ operating cash generated in Q1 2024 despite heavy capex. | Ability to fund new gigafactories, 4680 cell production, and R&D without dilutive financing. |
| **Vehicle‑delivery acceleration** – 422,000 units shipped in Q1 2024; FY 2024 deliveries projected > 1.5 M. | Continued market‑share gains in North America, Europe, and China. |
| **Strategic technology advantage** – Deployment of 4680 cells, Dojo AI super‑computer, and Level‑3‑approved FSD. | Cost‑lead and high‑margin software growth, setting the stage for autonomous ride‑hailing. |
| **Valuation** – Stock trading at ~12 % YTD gain and a forward P/E of ~31×, modestly above peer EV makers. | Premium valuation justified by growth runway but warrants monitoring of macro‑risk. |

The outlook to 2030 envisions **$176 bn‑$200 bn** in revenue, **$30 bn‑$40 bn** in net income, and **3‑3.5 M** vehicles delivered annually, driven by the forthcoming *Model 2* (sub‑$30k), *Cybertruck*, *Tesla Semi*, and a rapidly expanding *Tesla Energy* platform.
